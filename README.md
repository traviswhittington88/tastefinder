## Summary 

Taste Finder is a fun and useful application that integrates the Tastedive and Youtube APIs to present recommendation information in a new and exciting way. The dark grey background was chosen intentionally to highlight the more eye-popping art and colorfol neons that appear on the page, without being two overwhelming on the eyes. The ice-cream cone logo is 100% original and was designed by my uncle Daniel Packard, who is an amazing artist. He really brought the application together with this final touch. 

The UX if simple and relies on you to click a search tab: anything, books, authors, movies, music. From there, you type any string related to the tab selected above e.g. music/Pink Floyd, and click recommmend. Taste Finder currently recommends a single media type in response and produces 3 related videos from Youtube, but this is not set in stone. I will continue to change the application based on user requests because I believe a good application is one that is flexible. 

One thing I really tried hard to accomplish with Taste Finder was to maintain a simple interface while providing an original and authentic source of information, as well as a brand that will stick in your mind (i.e., the ice-cream logo). With the user's feedback I hope to see this application continue to grow in a positive direction. Don't forget to click the live link below to view the app in action!
